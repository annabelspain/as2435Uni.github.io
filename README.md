This is my portfolio website! 

As I am currently studying a masters degree (MSc Computer Science with Digital Media), I have a wide range of different projects which I would like to add to my 
portfolio, of which I hope to include over the next few months. At the moment, this portfolio is demonstrating some of the work which I had completed within my 
undergraduate degree (BSc Hons Digital Media) so I am looking to expand on this.
