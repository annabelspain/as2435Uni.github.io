                            Designing and developing 3D models and animations are my passion. Through the progression
                            of my Bachelor’s degree this knowledge has been expanded on and evolved towards a professional 
                            standard. Widening my knowledge of website design and development practices has provided 
                            insight into a variety of different coding languages. All establishing the basis for a range of
                            successful 3D animations and interactive websites. Through volunteering as Course Representative 
                            and founding a computing society, I have proactively worked at enhancing my collaboration skills.
                            Mentoring has also encouraged this, but has allowed for personal ambitions to be revitalised 
                            through helping others achieve their own.

                                        Through the second year of my University of Brighton course within Digital 
                                        Media, one of the assignments tasked in the first semester was to develop a 
                                        rest API for a client. It was asked that the rest API would be fully responsive,
                                        standards compliant and a single page application which uses vanilla HTML, CSS
                                        and JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically display search
                                        results to query the V&A API through HTTP requests. To begin with this assignment 
                                        was very challenging as I had never worked on anything like this before, but 
                                        it provided an opportunity to test my skills and progress my knowledge within 
                                        this subject. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To begin this assignment a range of different tutorials were used to progress my
                                        skills within JavaScript and using HTTP requests to receive data from an API. 
                                        These tutorials were found on YouTube, along with tasks which were given within 
                                        lectures to test my knowledge and skill. Working on the different tasks allowed 
                                        for external research into the different opportunities when using JavaScript, 
                                        including the use of conversions between different monies and temperatures. 
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="images/css.jpg" class="modal1Img">
                                    <p>
                                        When the assignment begun the first pages to be developed were a simple HTML page 
                                        and the background JavaScript to ensure the functionality before the site was 
                                        decorated. The simple HTML page consisted of a form, a background image and a 
                                        back to top button. JavaScript was then used to add functionality to the page
                                        and to connect to the V&A’s API. Firstly the JavaScript was connected to the 
                                        form within the HTML using event listeners, with the function ‘getVA’ underneath 
                                        which retrieves the data from the API and returns it to the page. When the user
                                        searches the API the JavaScript builds the URL to see the documentation, then 
                                        empty’s the previous results, parses the JSON string, loops over the data to 
                                        retrieve the specified data in the search bar, collects the specified elements 
                                        (including the image, artist name, artwork title, ect…) and returns this. 
                                        Although an else statement has also been added to provide feedback to the user 
                                        if the data could not be collected, and finally at the end sends the outcome 
                                        of everything which has been retrieved to the HTML page. 
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="images/css.jpg" class="modal1Img">
                                    <p>
                                        After working on the background functions of the website, the CSS when then
                                        developed to improve how the outputted information would look to the user. 
                                        The overall style of the page was changed by adding a translucent header and
                                        footer with a customised back to top button. The search bar was fixed to the
                                        top of the page even when scrolling and was edited to be responsive and 
                                        have the search icon separate to the search bar. The result images were 
                                        also styled to come out in a responsive grid format, helping the design to
                                        be more attractive to the audience. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Overall this assignment allowed for the progression in a wide range of different
                                        skills which can be applied to many future projects. Although this assignment 
                                        was difficult I am proud of what I have learnt from it and look to develop 
                                        more websites like this in the future to improve my skills further.

                                        During the first year of University one of the second year assignment was to
                                        create an online portfolio which would showcase all of my work in a professional
                                        manor. To begin the assignment an action plan was developed to describe all of
                                        the research which was used for this assignment but also to show how the ideas
                                        have progressed throughout this assignment using sketches, mind maps and 
                                        Adobe Photoshop mock ups. This started with the target sector which was 
                                        researched to understand more about the jobs which I would be available to go
                                        into including both front-end development jobs and back-end development jobs
                                        . The research showed how it would be advantageous to progress my skills 
                                        within different types of code including PHP, JavaScript, GSAP and JQuery 
                                        widening my knowledge for my future years in the industry.

                                        To develop the site itself, many different elements were included to appeal to the
                                        user as much as possible. The main body of the site was developed using HTML, with
                                        all the content being created by myself to improve the originality of the site.
                                        Once all of the basic HTML was added to the site, CSS was then used to style all
                                        of the elements within the site, adding animation, interactivity and colour. 
                                        Looking back on this assignment there were many hurdles which were faced and 
                                        overcome, as I had never worked on a site without having aid from lecturers and 
                                        tutorials, so my own initiative was used to learn all of the elements of site 
                                        in my spare time. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Along with the development of the site, many of the assets were created especially 
                                        for the new portfolio website, including the hero image, and the concept images which
                                        were included in the ‘concept image’ section of the new site. Both Adobe Photoshop
                                        and Illustrator were used to design these assets, and were developed to enhance 
                                        the visual aesthetics of the site.  
                                    </p>

                                        Overall I was very happy with the outcome of this website as it contained all of 
                                        the elements which was in the plan to be included. As this was the first time working
                                        by myself on a website there were many elements which had been learnt from doing 
                                        this, including user interactions, HTML and CSS techniques. If this assignment were 
                                        to be given again, JavaScript and PHP could be added to enhance the interactivity and
                                        animation throughout the site, along with a change in layout to continue user 
                                        interaction throughout the whole website.

                                        For the first semester of first year, the brief was given that a multimedia artefact
                                        needed to be created around a subject which we are passionate about. To begin this 
                                        assignment, a layout design was needed to show exactly how the finished design would
                                        look so to begin this my passions were thought about to choose what topic the artefact
                                        would be based upon. The concept which was developed evolved around my love of 
                                        Japanese landscapes and culture, which was taken forth into a multimedia application.
                                        To understand a bit more about Japan both books and the internet were used to learn 
                                        more about the culture and how it could be implemented into the artefact. Image 
                                        references and information were taken from these sources to determine which elements
                                        could be included into the design. The main elements which were decided to be 
                                        included into the design were the Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine, Studio Ghibli and 
                                        about the Geisha culture.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To get a better understanding of how each of the individual pages were going to look,
                                        a few sketches were created to show the layouts and animation elements within the design.
                                        Two different designs were sketched out, providing options to choose from when designing 
                                        the artefact. Between the two sketches the later was chosen with the pin points on Japan
                                        which would lead the audience onto the different pages within the design. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        When it came to the development of the design, the brief required for Adobe Animate to be
                                        used to help introduce the students into different forms of animation. The process of 
                                        placing each page into the same animate scene by changing all the animations into move 
                                        clips was used to begin the assignment, then placing the pages onto one action script 
                                        scene, allowing for one continuous animation which could be toggled between. Once all
                                        the information had been transferred the next stage was to lay out all the information
                                        within each page. This was achieved by placing all the layers of one page into a folder
                                        and organising the folder to show the elements which are at the back of the scene, at
                                        the bottom of the folder, and with the elements which are at the front of the scene
                                        at the top of the folder, allowing for nothing to overlap within the scene, and 
                                        ensuring that the design is still the same. Organisation was then started, grouping 
                                        similar elements on the timeline together and then shuffling along separate elements 
                                        to create a continuous timeline with no breaks. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <img src="images/timeline.jpg" class="modal3Img">
                                    <p>
                                        Animations within the artefact were then developed using a variety of motion tweens,
                                        motion paths and button animations, which were creating using content developed in 
                                        Adobe Photoshop with the final piece of animation being the Video which was taken from 
                                        another source (YouTube). In order to import the video file it needed to be formatted as
                                        a .flv file which could then be imported into the Animate programme and added to a specific
                                        page on the artefact. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Throughout the whole artifact there is a range of ActionScript which has been used to create
                                        elements like the buttons, and to change the music in the scene. Using a separate action 
                                        layer and different code snippets, the artefact could be brought together and connected to 
                                        all the different elements within the artefact.
                                    </p>

                                        Overall there were a range of different skills which had been learnt from this assignment, 
                                        including design techniques, ActionScript coding and user interaction. Although, looking 
                                        back there are a few elements which I would change about this assignment, improved I am 
                                        happy with the outcome because of the progress which I have made through this assignment.

                                            Within the second year of my Digital media course one of the modules which chosen
                                            was 3D animation and modelling, in which it was tasked to create a three dimensional
                                            character or landscape using Autodesk Maya. First and theme was chosen for this
                                            assignment, which was decided to be the forest spirit form the popular Japanese
                                            animation film ‘Princess Mononoke’ which closely resembled a deer, allowing for
                                            different images of deer to be used as references for scale. One of the main 
                                            references which was used when creating the animal was a side profile image of
                                            the forest spirit (taken from a blog post online) which was projected onto an

                                            providing correct proportions for the animal.

                                            the realism of the animation. To begin the texturing, it was originally attempted to 
                                            use the hyper shade within Maya, but this did not give the desired effect which the 
                                            model required. Having hair on the body was the next thought, so research went into 
                                            the use of Nhair and 3D paint textures which were attempted on the model but displayed
                                            an issue with the modelling as the hairs came out of random sections of the body, 
                                            which did not look realistic and could not be adjusted even after adjusting the 
                                            direction of the normals. After many attempts taking the model into different 
                                            software (including Blender), the Maya 3D paint tool was referred back to and used
                                            on the model after the whole model had been ungrouped, allowing for each individual
                                            element of the model to be separated and viewed individually, supporting the paint
                                            not to be repeated around the body.

                                            When it came to animate the model there were a few issues which were encountered during
                                            this process, as some of the ligaments were indirectly connected to other elements of 
                                            the design. This was mostly overcome using skin paint weights to avoid unwanted movement 
                                            when working on the model. A rig was created throughout the body, with handles which were
                                            used to move the different elements of design separately. The finished animation 
                                            showed the forest spirit taking small steps whilst looking around the environment 
                                            with different gestures.

                                            Overall this assignment challenged all of my skills within the subject, but also allowed
                                            the progression of my skills in the new techniques which I had learnt. The result of 
                                            the assignment is what I had planned to achieve although if I were to go back to this 
                                            assignment I would investigate more into adding hair onto different models.
